A {% topic_link "Introduction" "Deployment Pipeline" %} is composed of a number of stages. 

<br/>
> **Each stage consists of set of {% topic_link "Task" "tasks" %} which are run to accomplish a specific purpose.**

<br/>

Stages may also contain {% topic_link "Environment Variable" "Environment Variables" %} that can be
used by the tasks and may also generate {% topic_link "Build Artifacts" "Artifacts" %} which can be used by subsequent stages.

The stages can either be test stages each evaluating the build from a different perspective or deployment
stages which deploy your application to specific environments.

## Stages in Snap

In Snap every stage runs in a **clean and isolated environment**. So, if you set any state in the previous stage it may not
be available in the subsequent stages. If you want to set such states you should either use {% topic_link "Build Artifacts" "Build Artifacts" %}
or {% topic_link "Setup Tasks" "Setup Tasks" %}.
