title:  "Pinning commands"
---

When you set up your build on Snap, you will usually have some commands that are common to most stages.
Typically these commands will setup the right environment required for your any stage to run.
Common examples include installing your build dependencies, setting up the database, etc.
Instead of re-writing these commands before every stage, Snap allows you to pin such commands out in something we call *Setup Commands*.

> **A Setup Command is a command that is runs before every stage.**

## Speeding up your setup tasks

One of the most common use-case for setup commands is to install your build
dependencies. Every build has its own cache directory. You can speed the
process of installation by installing them in the cache directory. As you can
see in the above example we added a setup command that does a `bundle install
--path $SNAP_CACHE_DIR/.bundle`.  Snap makes a best attempt to keep the cache directory
around across your stage and build runs. So if you configure your setup task to
install your build tools in the cache directory, your subsequent stages and
pipelines can re-use it.
