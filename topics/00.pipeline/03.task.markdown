A stage is composed of a sequence of tasks.

## Tasks in Snap

Every task in Snap runs in its own shell. Due to this, if you export an environment variable in a previous task, it may not be available in the subsequent tasks.
We recommend using {% topic_link "Environment Variable" "Environment Variables" %} for exporting environment variables to your builds.
