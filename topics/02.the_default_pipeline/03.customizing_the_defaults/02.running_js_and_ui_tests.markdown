### xvfb

UI tests usually need the X-Window system unless you are running your tests using something like PhantonJS. To run UI tests on Snap, prefix the build tasks with `xvfb-run`. xvfb-run is a wrapper for the xvfb command which simplifies the task for running commands. <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xvfb-run.1.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information on xvfb-run.

For example, if *spec:features* requires the X-Window system, the build task will be `xvfb-run bundle exec spec:features`.

**Note:** captybara-webkit based tests also require the X-Window system.

###javascript tests

Running Javascript tests is similar to any other UI test which requires either a browser or WebKit. Similarly, you will need to prefix Javascript test rake tasks with `xvfb-run`.

**For example:** You could configure Jasmine tests to run with a task such as `xvfb-run bundle exec rake jasmine:ci`.
