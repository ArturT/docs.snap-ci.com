### xvfb

UI tests usually need the X-Window system unless you are running your tests using something like PhantonJS. To run UI tests on Snap, prefix the build tasks with `xvfb-run`. `xvfb-run` is a wrapper for `xvfb` command which simplifies the task for running commands. <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xvfb-run.1.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information on xvfb-run.

E.g. if `spec:features` requires X-Window system to run, the build task will be `xvfb-run bundle exec spec:features`.

**Note:** captybara-webkit based tests also require the X-Window system.

###javascript tests

Running Javascript tests is similar to any other UI test which requires either a browser or WebKit. Similarly, you will need to prefix Javascript test rake tasks with `xvfb-run`.

**For example:** For Jasmine tests, a build task such as `xvfb-run bundle exec rake jasmine:ci` should suffice.
