title:  "Build artifacts"
---

Artifacts are the outputs produced by a stage. These may the output of tests (such as console logs, screenshots of failures etc.), the output of tools (coverage reports, dependency charts etc.) or build artifacts such as gems and Rails applications packaged as war-files. With Snap, you can configure the output of any project directory as an artifacts and the content of that directory will be packaged up as an archive and be made available as a download.

### Configuring & downloading artifacts

When configuring a stage, you can configure multiple directories as artifacts. The contents of each of these directories can then be downloaded from the build history page.

### Propagating artifacts

One of the key advantages of a build pipeline is the fact that generated artifacts are not just available for download, but are also available for subsequent stages. For example, a gem generated by a rake task in the first stage of a pipeline can be installed and tested in subsequent stages and finally uploaded to http://rubygems.org/ in the final stage. The key here is that the gem is not rebuilt every time. It is the exact same binary. The same binary that was generated when the unit tests passed is propagated to subsequent stages for installation, verification and finally for upload.
