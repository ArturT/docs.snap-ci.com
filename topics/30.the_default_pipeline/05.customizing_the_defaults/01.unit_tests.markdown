### Running additional targets:

To run any targets other than the default, you need to just edit the list of targets that get executed by default. While doing so, just make sure to keep tests that run quickly and in isolation and ones that test multiple components or through the UI in separate suites.

### db:schema:load vs. db:test:prepare

By default, Snap executes db:migrate and db:test:prepare to prepare your database for running tests. In some cases, it may be preferable to run db:schema:load instead of db:test:prepare - especially if your older migrations no longer run. In such cases, you may need to edit the stage to change this task appropriately.
