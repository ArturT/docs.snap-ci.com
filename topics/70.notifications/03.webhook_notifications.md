title:  "Webhook notifications"

Snap can send out build notifications as a JSON payload and post it to a supplied webhook endpoint. This is most useful if you need
programmatic control on build events. Snap's webhook notifications are more granular than others. While most notification channels
send alerts on pipeline completion, the webhook will be triggered once for every stage.

The webhook endpoint can be configured for a project by navigating to its notification configuration section.

# Example build notification payload

```
{
 "project_name": "example/awesome-project",
 "stage_name": "FastFeedback",
 "counter": 1,
 "build_result": "Passed"
}
```
