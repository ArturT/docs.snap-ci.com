# The variables I exported in the commands is not taking into effect.

Every command runs in its own shell. Due to this, if you export an environment variable as a previous command,
it may not be available to the subsequent commands. We recommend defining environment variables in the **Environment Variable** section of the stage.

As an example, if you setup a stage with the following commands, they wont work:

*$ export MY_ENV="env"*

*$ echo ${MY_ENV} \# won't work.*

If there is a case where the environment variables are dynamically generated, you can write them to a file and then source
the file before every command that requires those variables as shown in the following example:

*$ echo MY_ENV="env" \> env_variables*

*$ source env_variables; some_command_that_needs_the_variables*

*$ source env_variables; some_other_command_that_needs_the_variables*

# My build can't find the dependencies from the previous stages.

Every stage in Snap starts with a clean and isolated environment. Hence, if you made any changes to the build machine
such as installing packages or build dependencies in the previous stages they may not be available in the current stage
as it may be running on a different machine. If you wish to persist the state across stages it is recommended to use
<a href="/pipeline/#pinning-common-setup-commands">Setup commands</a> or <a href="/pipeline/#artifact">Artifacts</a>.
