# The variables I exported in the commands is not taking into effect.

Every command runs in its own shell. Due to this, if you export an environment variable as a previous command,
it may not be available to the subsequent commands. We recommend defining environment variables in the Environment Variable section of the stage.

# My build can't find the dependencies from the previous stages.

Every stage in Snap starts with a clean and isolated environment. Hence, if you made any changes to the build machine
such as installing packages or build dependencies in the previous stages they may not be available in the current stage
as it may be running on a different machine. If you wish to persist the state across stages it is recommended to use
<a href="/pipeline/#pinning-common-setup-commands">Setup commands</a> or <a href="/pipeline/#artifact">Artifacts</a>.
