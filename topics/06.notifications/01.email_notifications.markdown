Snap will automatically send out build notifications via email. Email is delivered to all GitHub collaborators of the project.
Notifications are only raised for events that require attention, such as a failing build, a manual trigger of a stage and so on.


Here's an example of a notification email:

```
Pipeline result: PASSED
  Counter: 188
  Stages:
    FastFeedBack: passed
  Commits:
    master: 89abaca J. Random Hacker <jrandomhacker@example.org> Fix this build.

Prior pipeline result: FAILED
  Counter: 187
  Stages:
    FastFeedBack: failed
```
