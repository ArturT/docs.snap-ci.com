title:  "Webhook notifications"

Snap can send out build notifications as a JSON payload and post it to a supplied webhook endpoint. This is most useful if you need
programmatic control on build events. The webhook endpoint can be configured for a project by navigating to its notification configuration
section.

Here's the schema for the build notification payload:
```
{
 "project_name": "example/awesome-project",
 "stage_name": "FastFeedback",
 "counter": 1,
 "build_result": "Passed"
}
```
