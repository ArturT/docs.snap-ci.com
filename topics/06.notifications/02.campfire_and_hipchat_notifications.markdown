Snap can deliver build notifications to [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) amongst other notification channels.

Setting up Campfire notifications is easy. Here's how you can get started:

* Navigate to the notifications configuration section from your project's build history page.

* Snap will tell you that you haven't configured any Campfire credentials. Click on the appropriate link to add them.

  * If your Campfire site is hosted at `example.campfirenow.com`, fill in `example` in the subdomain field.
  * The room you mention must exist. Snap will not create a Campfire room.
* Navigate back to the notification configuration.
* Click on Start Campfire Notifications.
* You're done! Snap will notify you when important events, such as build failure, occur.
HipChat notifications can be configured in a similar manner.
