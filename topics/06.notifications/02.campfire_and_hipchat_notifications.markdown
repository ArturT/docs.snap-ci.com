Snap can deliver build notifications to [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) amongst other notification channels.

Setting up Campfire notifications is easy. Here's how you can get started:

 - Navigate to the notifications configuration section from your project's build history page.

   ![notification icon](/assets/images/screenshots/notification-icon.png)

 - Snap will tell you that you haven't configured any Campfire credentials. Click on the appropriate link to add them.

 - Navigate back to the notification configuration.

 - Click on Start Campfire Notifications.

 - You're done! Snap will notify you when important events, such as build failure, occur.

HipChat notifications can be configured in a similar manner.
