Snap can deploy Ruby and Rails and Java applications directly to Heroku. Upon successful completion of your build, you can configure Snap to deploy your application to Heroku. This can be done either automatically or, if you wish to deploy more infrequently, on demand at a later time. Yes- you can go back in history and deploy a build that ran a while ago. Snap maintains the state of the pipeline and can deploy from the exact same revision that triggered the build run.

* You can opt to specify a build pack if you wish to customize your deployment. [Read more about build packs on Heroku's site](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks).
* Click **save** to save this Heroku deployment configuration.

## Setting up subsequent deployments

Once you've authorized Snap with Heroku, setting up subsequent deployments becomes straight-forward as Snap reuses the credentials you used to setup your first deployment.

## Heroku configuration variables

You can optionally setup heroku configuration variables from Snap by navigating to the **Heroku Config Variables** tab when editing/creating a heroku deployment.

## Database migrations

After pushing new code, you may want to run the rails `db:migrate` task. This can be done by checking the **Perform db migration** checkbox.
