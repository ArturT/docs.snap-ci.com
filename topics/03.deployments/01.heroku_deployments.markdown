title:  "Deploying to Heroku"
---

Snap has first-class support for deploying Ruby and Rails applications directly to Heroku. Upon a successful build, we'll deploy the application to Heroku if your deployment is configured to do automatic deploys, or you may deploy any particular build at a later time.

To setup a heroku deployment:

* Visit the configuration page for your project and click the **Edit** link
* Click **Add New** to add a new stage to your build.
* Select **Heroku Deployment Stage** to select a heroku deployment stage.
* Enter the correct heroku API key and other parameters to ensure that we push to the correct heroku application
![Heroku deployment]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/screenshots/heroku-deployment.png)
* You can optionally setup any heroku configuration variables
![Heroku configuration variables]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/screenshots/heroku-deployment-config-vars.png)
* Click **save** to save this heroku deployment configuration.

# Database migrations

After pushing new code, you may want to run the rails `db:migrate` task. This can be done by checking the **Perform db migration** checkbox.
