Snap is a hosted continuous integration and continuous delivery service. We offer first-class support for these languages. We attempt to perform automatic detection of your repository to determine how to setup dependencies and tests. This detection may at times be incomplete and you may edit your pipeline configuration as appropriate.

Snap provides support for the following languages:


* {% topic_link "Ruby/JRuby" "Ruby/JRuby" %}
* {% topic_link "Python" "Python" %}
* {% topic_link "NodeJS" "NodeJS" %}
* {% topic_link "PHP" "PHP" %}
* {% topic_link "Java" "Java" %}
* {% topic_link "Groovy/Gradle" "Groovy/Gradle" %}
