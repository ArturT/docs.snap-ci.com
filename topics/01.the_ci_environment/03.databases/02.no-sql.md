title:  "NoSQL Datastores"

Snap supports multiple {% topic_link 'Relational databases' 'relational'%} and NoSQL datastores. {% include database-intro.markdown %}

# Connecting to the datastores:

These services all run on localhost and default ports which are as follows:

* **CouchDB**: localhost:5984
* **MongoDB**: localhost:27017
* **Redis**:   localhost:6379

Common clients/libraries which use these, such as CouchRest, Mongoid or Resque should all "just work". For example, the default mongoid.yml set up by the gem would look something like this and would work out of the box.

If you have any trouble with any of these, [let us know]({{ site.link.contact_us }}).
