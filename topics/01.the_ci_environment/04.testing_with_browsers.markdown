title:  "Testing with browsers"
---

This guide documents functional testing using headless and browser testing tools provided by Snap.

Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds.

The following testing tools and browsers are available on the CI environment:

* phantomjs - {{ site.versions.phantomjs }}
* google-chrome - {{ site.versions['google-chrome-stable'] }}
* google-chrome-driver - {{ site.versions['google-chrome-driver'] }}
* firefox - {{ site.versions.firefox }}


# Using PhantomJS

Snap has PhantomJS (version {{ site.versions.phantomjs }}) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`.

# Using Chromedriver

> **Users are required to use the chromedriver executable available on the build machines over downloading and installing their own. Downloading other versions of chromedriver are known to not work. [Contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }}) if you'd like a different version of chromedriver.**

Snap has Chromedriver (version {{ site.versions['google-chrome-driver'] }}) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`. Snap uses a modified chromedriver that is tested and works well with our build machines.
