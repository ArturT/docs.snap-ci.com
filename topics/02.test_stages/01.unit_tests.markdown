title:  "Unit tests"

Snap runs heuristics on your code base to determine whether a project is using **RSpec** or **test-unit** framework. It does this by examining the project structure. If a **'test'** directory is present at the PROJECT_ROOT it configures a stage to run these tests. Similarly, if a **'spec'** directory is present, the tests are configured to run using **RSpec**.

# test-unit:

When **test-unit** is detected, the `test:units`  and `test:functionals` tasks are configured to run in a stage named <span class="stage-name">FastFeedback</span>. This stage is configured to be the very first stage of the build pipeline. If an **integration** directory is present, the `test:integration` task is configured in the next stage named <span class="stage-name">Integration</span>. If the project is a Ruby gem, it would only configure the `test` task.

# RSpec:

If **RSpec** is detected then it would configure tasks based on the standard directories present in the spec folder. E.g. If it detects a models directory within spec then it will add `spec::models` to the list of rake tasks to run for the build. It detects presence of the following directories **features, requests, models, controllers, views, helpers, mailers, lib, routing.**
