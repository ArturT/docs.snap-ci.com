Snap runs detection to determine whether a project is using **RSpec** or **test-unit** framwork. This it does by examining the project structure. If **'test'** directory is present at PROJECT_ROOT it will configure a **test-unit** stage. If **'spec'** directory is present it would use **RSpec**.

test-unit
===========

If **test-unit** is detected, then it would add `["test:units"]` , `["test:functionals"]` to the list of rake task to be run for the build. If integration directory is present then it would add `["test:integration"]` to the list. If PROJECT is a ruby gem its would only configure `["test"]`


RSpec
==========

If **RSpec** is detected then it would configure tasks based on the standard directories present spec folder. E.g. If it detects a models directory within spec then it will add `["spec::models"]` to the list of rake task to run for the build. It detects presence of following directories **features, requests, models, controllers, views, helpers, mailers, lib, routing.**
