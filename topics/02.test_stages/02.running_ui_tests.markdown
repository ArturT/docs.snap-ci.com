title:  "Running UI tests"

UI tests generally requires X-Window system. For running UI tests on Snap, prepend all build tasks with `xvfb-run`. xvfb-run is a wrapper
for Xvfb command which simplifies the task for running commands. For more information on xvfb-run. See <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xvfb-run.1.html" target="_blank">xvfb-run</a>

E.g. if `spec:features` requires X-Window system to run, the build task will be `xvfb-run bundle exec spec:features`.

Note: Webkit also requires X-Window system.
