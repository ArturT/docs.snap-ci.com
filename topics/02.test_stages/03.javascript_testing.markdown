Running Javascript tests are similar to {% topic_link "running ui tests" "running ui tests" %} which require either a browser or
WebKit. Prefix Javascript test rake tasks with `xvfb-run`.

**For example:** For Jasmine tests, a build task such as `xvfb-run bundle exec rake jasmine:ci` should suffice.
