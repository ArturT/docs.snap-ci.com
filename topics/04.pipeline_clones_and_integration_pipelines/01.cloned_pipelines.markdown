title:  "Cloning a pipeline"
---

Cloning a pipeline creates a new project which has all the stages you selected at the time of creation of the clone and it will build against the cloned branch. The new project created has stages which are exactly similar to the stages of the parent pipeline from which you cloned the new project but it doesn't clone any heroku deployments configured for the parent pipeline.

##Steps to create a clone

  * Goto the **build_history** page of the pipeline you wish to clone.

  * Click on the **Clones** link which will bring up the clone dialog.
