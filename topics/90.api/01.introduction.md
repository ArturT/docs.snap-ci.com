Snap API provides a way to query and perform operations that you would otherwise use the web interface for.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `api.snap-ci.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

# Authentication

All APIs require you to authenticate yourself using your API key. You may find the API key in the [user settings](https://snap-ci.com/settings/api_key). If authentication fails, Snap will return status `404` or `401`.

## Basic authentication

Snap uses basic authentication. To authenticate you need to provide your username and API key.

` $ curl -ualice:API_KEY https://api.snap-ci.com/`
