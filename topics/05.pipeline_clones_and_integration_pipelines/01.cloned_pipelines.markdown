title:  "Cloning a pipeline"
---

If you maintain a release branch or practice branch based development the pipeline clone feature will come in handy. Using this feature, you can quickly setup a clone of your existing pipeline while tracking a different branch. By default, the clone will include all non-deployment stages. The newly created clone is independent from the original. You can choose to modify it as you please without affecting the original pipeline.

Note: When setting up builds for feature branches or others, consider using an {% topic_link "Integration pipelines" 'integration pipeline' %}. If you use branches regularly as a part of your development process, consider {% topic_link "Automatically tracking branches on Github" 'setting up Snap to automatically track branches on your repository' %}.

## Steps to create a clone:

* Visit the build history of the pipeline you wish to clone.
* Click on the **clones** link which will bring up the clone dialog.
