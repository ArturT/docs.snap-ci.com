Snap can deliver build notifications to [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) amongst other notification channels.

## Setting up Campfire notifications:

* Navigate to the notifications configuration section from your project's build history page.
  <p>![notification icon](/assets/images/screenshots/notification-icon.png)</p>
* Snap will tell you that you haven't configured any Campfire credentials. Click on the appropriate link to add them.

  If your Campfire site is hosted at *example.campfirenow.com*, fill in *example* in the subdomain field. Note that Snap will not create the Campfire room and so the room must exist to begin with.    
* Navigate back to the notification configuration.
* Click on Start Campfire Notifications.
* You're done! Snap will notify you when important events, such as build failure, occur.

HipChat notifications can be configured in a similar manner.
