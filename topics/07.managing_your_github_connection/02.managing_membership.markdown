For any project building running on Snap, a user who is a collaborator on the repository on GitHub may get to see the project build on Snap. You may optionally force a sync with GitHub to ensure that project membership in Snap are in line with collaborations on GitHub.


To perform a sync:

* Click on **Configuration > Collaborators** link on the build history page to configure your project.
* We'll list the existing collaborators. To force a sync, click **Sync with GitHub**

* Once the collaboratores have been synched, we'll list the changes we've made.
