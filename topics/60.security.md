In order to protect your data, Snap stores the various user credentials in a separate data-store which is not accessible
to the front-end app directly. All credentials are always stored in an encrypted format. Snap stores the
following credentials in this data-store:

* [GitHub OAuth Token](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#oauth)
* [GitHub Deploy Key for your repository](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys)
* [Heroku OAuth Token](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/oauth)
* [RubyGems API Key](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#api-authorization)
* [HipChat API Key](https://www.hipchat.com/docs/api)
* Campfire API Key

Snap also generates a Key Pair for every repository you setup. This key pair is then used to encrypt any repository specific data
like [Environment Variables]({{ url }}/pipeline/#environment-variables), SSH keys, etc.
