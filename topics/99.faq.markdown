## Do you support language X?

We currently support Ruby, NodeJS and Java. If you'd like to see your favorite language being supported by Snap, then [contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }}). See {% topic_link "supported platforms" "supported platforms" %} for more on the specifics for each platform.

## Can I get a specific version of a language or build tool?

See {% topic_link "supported platforms" "supported platforms" %} for the list of versions we support. If your version is not listed,  please [contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }})

## Do you support database X?

We currently support MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3. You can also use external services such as MongoHQ easily. We plan to add support for a few other data-stores very soon. If you'd like to see your favorite database on that list, then [contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }}). See {% topic_link "supported platforms" "supported platforms" %} for what is supported.

## Do you support deployments to platform X?

We currently support out-of-the-box deployments to Heroku. However, most platforms support deployment using some CLI tools. You can configure a stage in Snap to invoke these tools or scripts to perform deployments. We have teams deploying to HP Cloud, Amazon AWS and other platforms using Snap.
