This guide documents functional testing using headless and browser testing tools provided by Snap.

Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds. If you're running GUI testing tools, you may want to checkout our guide on {% topic_link "Testing with browsers" "browser testing" %}.

# Using PhantomJS

Snap has PhantomJS (version {{ site.versions.phantomjs }}) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`.

# Using Chromedriver

> **Users are required to use the chromedriver executable available on the build machines over downloading and installing their own. Downloading other versions of chromedriver are known to not work. [Contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }}) if you'd like a different version of chromedriver.**

Snap has Chromedriver (version {{ site.versions['google-chrome-driver'] }}) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`. Snap uses a modified chromedriver that is tested and works well with our build machines.
