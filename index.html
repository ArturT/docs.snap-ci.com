<p>Getting started with Snap is straightforward for most applications. At its simplest, the steps involved are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sign in and grant access to Snap</li>
  <li>Select a repository</li>
  <li>Configure a deployment pipeline for it</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you select a repository, Snap automatically runs a set of heuristics on your repository to determine an appropriate {% topic_link "Introduction" "Deployment Pipeline" %} for you.
 While you can tweak and customize this significantly, the default should be sufficient to get you started.
 Have a look at the {% topic_link "Supported Platforms" "Supported Platforms" %} to see what the languages Snap supports.</p>
