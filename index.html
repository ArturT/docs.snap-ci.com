<p>Getting started with Snap is straightforward for most applications. At its simplest, the steps involved are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sign in & grant access to Snap to build your project</li>
  <li>Select a project</li>
  <li>Configure one or more Heroku deployments</li>
</ul>  

<p>Once you select a project, Snap automatically runs a set of heuristics on your project to determine an appropriate build pipeline for you. While you can tweak and customize this significantly, the default should be sufficient to get you started.</p>

<p>If for some reason, we were unable to determine an appropriate build plan for you, you can always set up custom test stages {% topic_link "unit tests" "as described here" %}.</p>
