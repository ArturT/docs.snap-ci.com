We recommend you to add files such as ssh keys and certificates as <%= topic_link 'Deployment Pipeline#secure-files', 'secure files' %>. It can be done in your project configuration screen. There, you'll be able to specify the file name, location, permissions and it's content.

<%= retina_image 'screenshots/getting-started/ssh-keys' %>

You can then use the files as ssh credentials to run your commands.
