To deploy to Amazon AWS with Snap, you configure a custom stage to run the steps required to deploy your application. Since there are a wide variety of deployment strategies to choose from on AWS, Snap provides the [AWS CLI](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on the command line. This allows you to use customized deployments for yourself.
