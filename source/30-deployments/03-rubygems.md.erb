You can easily deploy your gem to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) using Snap. If you have a .gemspec file in your repository Snap will automatically add a **Release** stage in your pipeline.

You can personalize your deployment by choosing the **Custom** RubyGems stage, similar to Heroku deployments.

## How we do it?

In order to publish your gem we run the commands `gem build *.gemspec` followed by `gem push *.gem`

## Where to find your API KEY on RubyGems

On your profile page in RubyGems click on ['Edit Profile'](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit) and look for **API Access**.
