Snap can deliver build notifications to [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) amongst other notification channels.

# Setting up Campfire notifications

* Navigate to the notifications configuration section from your project's build history page.

  <%= retina_image 'screenshots/notification-icon' %>
* Snap will tell you that you haven't configured any Campfire credentials. Click on the appropriate link to add them.
  <%= retina_image 'screenshots/campfire-credentials' %>

  If your Campfire site is hosted at *example.campfirenow.com*, fill in *example* in the subdomain field.
* Save the configuration, and then enter the chat room name that Snap should post to. Note that Snap will not create the Campfire room and so the room must exist to begin with.

  <%= retina_image 'screenshots/campfire-credentials-chat-room' %>

* Click on Save to start Campfire notifications
* You're done! Snap will notify you when important events, such as build failure, occur.

HipChat notifications can be configured in a similar manner.
