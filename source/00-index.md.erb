Getting started with Snap is straightforward for most applications. At its simplest, the steps involved are

* Sign in and grant access to Snap
* Select a repository
* Configure a deployment pipeline for it

Once you select a repository, Snap automatically runs a set of heuristics on your repository to determine an appropriate <%= topic_link "Deployment Pipeline", "Deployment Pipeline" %> for you. While you can tweak and customize this significantly, the default should be sufficient to get you started. Have a look at the <%= topic_link "The CI Environment", "the CI environment" %> to see what Snap supports.
