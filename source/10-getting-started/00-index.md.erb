Snap comes pre-installed with a lot of databases and datastores.

Getting started with Snap is straightforward for most applications. At its simplest, the steps involved are


## Step 1: Sign in

To sign up with Snap, visit [Snap CI](https://snap-ci.com) and click on the Sign in link at the top.

When you sign in, GitHub will ask if you want to give a set of
permissions to Snap. You may <%= topic_link 'How Snap integrates with GitHub', 'learn more' %> about them.

## Step 2: Add your project

Once you are signed in, Snap will present a list of all the
repositories you have access to. You may only build repositories. If
you are an administrator on any of those repositories, you may build
that repository on Snap.

## Step 3: Configure your project

When you select a repository to build on Snap, we will attempt to
automatically configure your project. You can always customize this
configuration by visiting the configuration page for that project.

> Setting up your build involves breaking it down into logical <%= topic_link 'deployment pipeline#stage', 'stages' %>. Each stage provides higher confidence in the code as it is deployed and tested in environments that are progressively more production like.
