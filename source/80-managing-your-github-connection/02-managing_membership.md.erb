For any project building running on Snap, a user who is a collaborator on the repository on GitHub may get to see the project build on Snap. You may optionally force a sync with GitHub to ensure that project membership in Snap are in line with collaborations on GitHub.


# To perform a sync

* Click on **Configuration > Collaborators** link on the build history page to configure your project.

* We'll list the existing collaborators. To add members of a team, click on **Add Team**
  <%= retina_image 'screenshots/github-collaboration/invite-collaborators-dialog' %>
* Then select each of the teams you want to make collaborators in Snap
