When a new repository is added in Snap, it will automatically sync all the collaborators from Github.
You may optionally force a sync with GitHub to ensure that project membership in Snap are in line with collaborations on GitHub.

> **Note** : 
Recently, GitHub introduced some changes to the Organizations which are managed with the effect that the Github organizations owners also need to be admin collaborator on the repository.

To be able to add a new repository on Snap, make sure you are part of a team that can administer the repository. This is due to recent Github changes in the way they deal with permissions
