title:  "Revoking privileges granted to Snap CI"
---

To ensure that Snap no longer gets to connect to GitHub on your behalf:

* Visit your [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile) on GitHub.
* Click **Applications**, and **Revoke** the access to the application named **Snap CI**.

You should also make sure that you visit the settings page for your project and remove any relevant **service hooks** and **deploy keys** that belong to Snap.

# Why does Snap need all these permissions?
