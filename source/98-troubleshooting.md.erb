# My build can't find the dependencies from the previous stages.

Every stage in Snap starts with a clean and isolated environment. Hence, if you made any changes to the build machine
such as installing packages or build dependencies in the previous stages they may not be available in the current stage
as it may be running on a different machine. If you wish to persist the state across stages it is recommended to use
<a href="/pipeline/#pinning-common-setup-commands">Setup commands</a> or <a href="/pipeline/#artifact">Artifacts</a>.

# My Protractor tests using Chromedriver are not working.

Some projects may attempt to download a brand new chromedriver to install inside your project. This normally happens if you depend on the chromedriver rubygem or npm package. Please, read <a href="/the_ci_environment/testing_with_browsers/#using-chromedriver">"using chromedriver"</a> for more details.

Some tips to configure run your Protractor tests:

* Do not use *xvfb-run*.
* Configure protractor to use our chromedriver. To set it, just change the configuration *chromeDriver* to */usr/local/bin/chromedriver*.
* Currently Protractor can't start selenium server inside our containers. To avoid this error you can set *chromeOnly* to *true*, then Protractor will use chromedriver directly.

# I need my ssh keys on Snap.

In need of storing sensitive files in your build? Follow <%= topic_link 'how do i add ssh keys to my build?', 'our guide' %> for more details.

# Bundle install fails for a private repository

A gem dependency for a private repository requires you to setup a ssh key with access to that repository. Follow <%= topic_link 'how do i add ssh keys to my build?', 'our guide' %> for more details.
