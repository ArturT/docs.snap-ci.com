Snap API provides a way to query and perform operations that you would otherwise use the web interface for.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `api.snap-ci.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

# Authentication

All APIs require you to authenticate yourself using your API key. You may find the API key in the [user settings](https://snap-ci.com/settings/api_key). If authentication fails, Snap will return status `404` or `401`.

## Basic authentication

Snap uses basic authentication. To authenticate you need to provide your username and API key.

<%= render_api_example 'api/basic-authentication',
      method: :get,
      url:    'https://api.snap-ci.com/'
%>

# Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 25 items by default. The `next` and `previous` page links, if applicable are included in the response body in the `_links` section.

<%= render_api_example 'api/pagination',
      method: :get,
      url:    'https://api.snap-ci.com/project/ketan/sinatra-sample/branch/master/pipelines?less_than_counter=30'
%>
