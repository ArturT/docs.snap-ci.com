This guide documents functional testing using headless and browser testing tools provided by Snap.

Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds.

The following testing tools and browsers are available on the CI environment:

* phantomjs - `<%= data.versions.phantomjs %>`
* google-chrome - `<%= data.versions['google-chrome-stable'] %>`
* google-chrome-driver - <%= monospaced_array_to_sentence_string(data.versions['google-chrome-driver']) %>
* firefox - `<%= data.versions.firefox %>`


# Using PhantomJS

Snap has PhantomJS (version <%= data.versions.phantomjs %>) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`.

# Using Chromedriver

> **Users are required to use the chromedriver executable available on the build machines over downloading and installing their own. Downloading other versions of chromedriver are known to not work. [Contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>) if you'd like a different version of chromedriver.**

Snap makes available version `2.10` of chromedriver on the `PATH`. If you'd like to use a different version of chromedriver, please specify an environment variable `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION` and set its value to one of the supported versions before you use chromedriver. Snap uses a modified chromedriver that is tested and works well with our build machines.
