title:  "Testing with browsers"
doc_title: 'Testing with Browsers on Snap CI'
---

This guide documents functional testing using headless and browser testing tools provided by Snap.

Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds.

The following testing tools and browsers are available on the CI environment:

* phantomjs - `<%= data.versions.phantomjs %>`
* google-chrome - `<%= data.versions['google-chrome-stable'] %>`
* google-chrome-driver - <%= monospaced_array_to_sentence_string(data.versions['google-chrome-driver']) %>
* firefox - `<%= data.versions.firefox %>`

[Contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>) if you'd like a different version of any of the browsers and tools.

# Using Chromedriver

> **Due to the combination of the container technology and OS version we provide, chromedriver needs to be setup with a few environment variables and command line flags. Users are required to use the `chromedriver` wrapper available on the `PATH` at `<%= stdout_and_stderr_of('which chromedriver') %>`.**

Calling the `chromedriver` wrapper will execute version `2.10` of chromedriver. If you'd like to use a different version of chromedriver, please specify an environment variable `CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION` and set its value to one of the supported versions before you use chromedriver.

## Using configuring chromedriver on Snap from various testing tools -

### protractor

We suggest adding the following lines to your protractor's `config.js` -

~~~javascript
exports.config = {/* your existing config */};

if (process.env.SNAP_CI) {
  exports.config.chromeDriver = '<%= stdout_and_stderr_of('which chromedriver').strip %>';
}
~~~


# Using PhantomJS

Snap has PhantomJS (version <%= data.versions.phantomjs %>) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`.
