doc_title: 'Testing with Browsers on Snap CI'

This guide documents functional testing using headless and browser testing tools provided by Snap.

Snap runs `xvfb` with a resolution of `1280x1024x16` and makes a `DISPLAY` variable available to your builds.

The following testing tools and browsers are available on the CI environment:

* phantomjs - <%= data.versions.phantomjs %>
* google-chrome - <%= data.versions['google-chrome-stable'] %>
* google-chrome-driver - <%= data.versions['google-chrome-driver'] %>
* firefox - <%= data.versions.firefox %>


# Using PhantomJS

Snap has PhantomJS (version <%= data.versions.phantomjs %>) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`.

# Using Chromedriver

> **Users are required to use the chromedriver executable available on the build machines over downloading and installing their own. Downloading other versions of chromedriver are known to not work. [Contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>) if you'd like a different version of chromedriver.**

Snap has Chromedriver (version <%= data.versions['google-chrome-driver'] %>) pre-installed. This is available on the `PATH`. Snap uses a modified chromedriver that is tested and works well with our build machines.
