Snap provides sbt version `<%= data.versions.sbt %>` on the `PATH`.

By default if Snap detects the presence of a `build.sbt` at your project root, it will execute
`sbt test assembly` in order to run your tests.

## Custom SBT arguments

For the most part the defaults for SBT and JVM options should work fine.

If required, you may tweak the arguments to suit your needs.

The complete list of arguments supported by sbt are listed here -
