Every stage in Snap runs on machines we call workers. Each worker has the following resources by default:

 * 2 CPUs
 * 2 GB of memory
 * 10 GB of disk space

You can specify the worker configuration in every stage of your pipeline. Worker configuration includes the number of workers and the size of each worker.

## Changing the number of workers

Selecting multiple workers allows you to run that stage in parallel. You can do various things with this like <%= topic_link 'Setting up test parallelism', 'test parallelism' %>, deploying to multiple servers, etc.

## Changing the size of each worker

Increasing the size of each worker allows you to multiply the resources allocated to each worker for that stage. For e.g. - selecting a container of size 3 will let your stage run with 6 CPUs and 6 GB of memory. This can be useful in cases where your stage requires more memory to build.

### Note on worker size and parallelism

While changing the number of workers and their size, Snap will respect the number of workers that you have purchased. For e.g., if your plan allows you 4 workers, you can have up to 4-way parallelism with single-sized-containers, two-way parallelism with double-sized-containers or no-parallelism with a quadruple sized container. However, if you want additional workers; say 4 way parallelism with quadruple sized workers, you can purchase additional workers. Up to 16 of them in fact. [Contact us](<%= data.links.contact_us %>) if you are interested in purchasing additional workers for your build.
